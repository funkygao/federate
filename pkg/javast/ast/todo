Business Logic Layer Identification:
Service and Controller Mapping: Identify and map out service classes, controllers, and their interactions. This helps in understanding how the application's business logic is structured and how requests flow through the system.
Implementation: Analyze package and class naming conventions (e.g., classes in service, controller, repository packages). Look for annotations like @Service, @Controller, @RestController, @Repository to categorize classes.
Business Process Identification: Trace and report on sequences of method calls that represent high-level business processes.
Implementation: Analyze method call chains starting from controller classes, following through services to repositories. Generate call graphs for these flows.

Code Smell Detection:
God Classes: Identify classes that have large size or too many responsibilities.
Feature Envy: Detect methods that heavily use data or methods from other classes.
Long Parameter Lists: Find methods with excessive parameters, which can indicate poor design.
Implementation: Use established code smell detection heuristics on the AST data.


Concurrency Analysis:
Threading Constructs Usage: Identify usage of threads, locks, synchronization primitives, and potential concurrency issues like deadlocks or race conditions.
Implementation: Look for usage of synchronized blocks, Thread class, ExecutorService, locks, and other concurrency utilities.


Logging and Monitoring Analysis:
Logging Usage: Analyze how logging is implemented, identify areas with excessive logging or lack of logging in critical areas.
Implementation: Search for logging library usage (e.g., log.info, log.debug) and map their distribution across the codebase.


Annotation and Framework Usage Report:
Custom and Framework Annotations: Generate a report on the usage of annotations, which can provide insights into framework usage and configuration.
Implementation: Collect and categorize annotations used in the code, highlighting those related to frameworks like Spring (@Autowired, @Transactional).


Design Pattern Detection:
Common Design Patterns: Identify implementations of common design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.).
Implementation: Use pattern recognition in the AST, looking for specific class structures, method signatures, and relationships that match known patterns.


API and Protocol Usage Analysis:
External API Calls: Identify code that makes calls to external APIs, web services, or uses specific protocols.
Implementation: Analyze import statements and method calls to classes known to perform external communication.

Event Handling and Messaging Analysis:
Publishers and Subscribers: Map out event producers and consumers within the codebase.
Implementation: Identify usage of messaging frameworks (e.g., JMS, Kafka) and annotations or methods that define event handling.


Potential Performance Issues:
Heavy Operations in Loops: Detect inefficient code patterns like database queries or I/O operations inside loops.
Implementation: Analyze loop constructs and the operations within them, flagging known expensive operations.
