Concurrency Analysis:
Threading Constructs Usage: Identify usage of threads, locks, synchronization primitives, and potential concurrency issues like deadlocks or race conditions.
Implementation: Look for usage of synchronized blocks, Thread class, ExecutorService, locks, and other concurrency utilities.

Annotation and Framework Usage Report:
Custom and Framework Annotations: Generate a report on the usage of annotations, which can provide insights into framework usage and configuration.
Implementation: Collect and categorize annotations used in the code, highlighting those related to frameworks like Spring (@Autowired, @Transactional).

Event Handling and Messaging Analysis:
Publishers and Subscribers: Map out event producers and consumers within the codebase.
Implementation: Identify usage of messaging frameworks (e.g., JMS, Kafka) and annotations or methods that define event handling.


Potential Performance Issues:
Heavy Operations in Loops: Detect inefficient code patterns like database queries or I/O operations inside loops.
Implementation: Analyze loop constructs and the operations within them, flagging known expensive operations.
